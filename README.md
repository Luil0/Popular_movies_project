# Popular Movies Dataset project

In this project I used movies csv and ratings csv from a dataset in kaggle to analyze popular movies. 
The movies in this dataset were rated from .5 to 5.

- cleaned the data and added functions to get the years from title string. 
- added function to get only titles from titles column
- changed column names for better readability
- created dataframes with pandas for better analysis to use with matplotlib

I analyzed movies data because I like movies and wanted to know what movies users like the most.
I also wanted to know which movies had the most 5 star ratings.
